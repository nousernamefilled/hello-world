# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub
Yesterday, I created my first R package. Today, step 2-putting it on GitHub. Currently, I still haven't figured how to shift it from my computer, to GitHub.
Short info about myself (The reason for my presence here)-I plan on creating (by copying 'foundation' codes from other folks) as many financial packages as possible. I hope I can. I hope I find it to be fun. I hope it will be fun.
